  <aside><h1>The History Of Boxing</h1></aside>
	
	<h3 class="h3">Where it began</h3>
	<p class="para1">
The sport of boxing was officially created in 3000BC on record, now this is not correct because there would have been fights between people before this time, but the actual sport was officially created on this date. The earliest dates of boxing go back to Egypt where it was suspectedly created. The sport was then introduced to the Olympics by the Greeks in the 7th century BC, where protection was worn on the hands of the opponents, but it was almost bare-knuckle fighting. Boxing then came a long way with rules being introduced, and over the years these rules have become a lot stricter. Boxing was then brought to America in the early 1700s where it blew up like most things do in America and the rest is history to where it is now today.

	<h3 class="h3">Where it is now</h3>
	<p class="para1">Boxing has obviously changed a lot over the last 100 years or so with a lot more organizations being put into place to protect these individuals when fighting, especially in the professional side of things. Boxing used to have a lot of cheaters in it, and you still see are cases of it today, with fighters tampering with their gloves etc. to gain a advantage over their opponents. This type of cheating was heavily cracked down on around the world war two time, where a lot of military soldiers would be caught cheating in fights, and this is where rules and companies came into boxing to stop all of this. Of course, over the time that boxing has been around the skill level has increased drastically. With more and more skills being brought to the table there is a lot to learn in the sport of boxing now a days and there is a style of fighting out there for everyone.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">The Rules That Have Been Introduced</h3>
	<p class="para1">Like I stated before there has been a lot of rules introduced to the sport of boxing to further improve on the health of the individuals fighting and it also means that they get a fair fight in the end. One of the major rules brought into the sport was the Marquis of Queensbury rules. This rule was brought into the sport in 1865 and more rules were added to it in the years to come. There are 12 rules overall and before this was brought into play boxing matches where basically bare-knuckle fights with no rules. These 12 rules gave each boxer a fair advantage in a fight. The referee in charge had to ensure that he/she knew exactly what the rule where. These rules came from Britain, and where later used all around the world to have fair fights in boxing. One of the major and most important rules on this list was the gloves that the fighters had to use. They had to be brand new gloves and agreed by both boxers on what size they would use for the gloves. Most of the time it is 12-ounce gloves used, but this can vary. The gloves had to of been checked by a third party commission before the fight and when the fighters hands were being wrapped they had to be overseen by someone, in order to make sure that there was no cheating or tampering with the gloves being made.</p>
