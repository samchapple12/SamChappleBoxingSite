	<h3 class="h3">Career</h3>
	<p class="para1">Floyd Mayweather Junior, born February 24, 1977, is again one of the greatest boxing sportsmen in the history of the sport. He competed professionally in the sport of boxing for over 20 years ending his last professional bout against Conor McGregor in 2017 by ref stoppage finalizing his career off with an outstanding 50-0 boxing record. Floyd Mayweather however was not seen to be as great as Ali was in his days. Floyd was seen as a money-making racket during his career hence where he got is nickname Floyd “Money” Mayweather. One of Floyd’s biggest pay-outs was over 250 million in one fight and that was in fact made during the McGregor fight. Floyd ranks second for the best pond for pound boxer of all time but still he does not have a great legacy behind him like Ali does. Mayweather however brought a lot of new skills to the boxing game, one of them being the famous shoulder roll, which can be seen in the tutorials section on this website. Floyd brought new and improved fast action and very skilful boxing to the table, which in years before him was not on his standards. The bar has been set so high for professional boxers to compete against the level of what Floyd used to fight like. He held 6 consecutive belts in 6 different weight divisions at the same time. This also being one of the first boxers to have held multiple titles in different weight divisions.</p> </div>

	  <h3 class="h3">Legacy</h3>
	<p class="para2">Floyd Mayweather on paper has left one of the best legacies known to man on this earth. It has been unheard of by someone winning that many fights in a row without a loss in the boxing community, not even the greatest of all time Muhammad Ali had a clear record like that. However unfortunately for Mayweather his personality and almost being this Hollywood actor instead of a role model has left an unfortunate stain on his career. He became more into boxing for the money then for his fans and people began to dislike him for this. But they can not forget the changes that Mayweather brought to the sport of boxing alone. Boxing had changed forever after him, and it will be hard for any boxer in the future to be like him. He will defiantly go down in history as one of the greats and be in the boxing hall of fame. Below again is a documentary which I found interesting about Floyd Mayweather give it a watch if you want to find out more… </p> </div>
